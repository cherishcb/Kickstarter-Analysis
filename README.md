Generally, the higher the amount, the lower is the percentage of success. Conversely, the percentage that a play fails goes higher at each increase in amount. However, this relationship is reverse in between budget of $30,000 to $45,000. It could be noted that there is little to no chance of a play being canceled. Based on the past trends, Louise has a higher percentage of success if she set a goal of less than $5,000.
