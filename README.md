Generally, the higher the amount, the lower is the percentage of success. Conversely, the percentage that a play fails goes higher at each increase in amount. However, this relationship is reverse in between budget of $30,000 to $45,000. It could be noted that there is little to no chance of a play being canceled.

The percentage of success goes higher towards August, with its peak in May. From September onwards, the trend continues to decline to its slack period from November to December. 

**Challenges**
Making the excel portion of the whole Kickstarter Project is easy. The challenge starts in interpreting the tables and charts. It is fun at the same time challenging. So far, the most difficult part is familiarizing with Github, and writing and editing the the Readme File. It is like learning a new language. Overall, it can be overcome by research, seeking advise from classmates and teachers.

### **Results**

Based on the trends, the best period for Louise to launch theater plays is from May to July. This is the peak season for theather shows. On the other hand, November and December is not the best time to launch a play.

As for the budget goals, Louise has a higher percentage of success if she set a goal of less than $5,000. 

This analysis covers data gathered for theater plays only. We based on the budget goals set and the launch date. It is also recommended to make analysis based on the amounts pledged and number of backers to know when is the best time to source funds.
